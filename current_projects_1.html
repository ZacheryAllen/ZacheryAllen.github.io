        <p>
          I've had several PC's laying around lately that have been doing a whole lot of nothing. In trying to understand why, I discovered that it's because I've had my desktop functioning as a Do-It-All machine. Unfortunately, being encased in a <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA2F84D69115&Description=corsair%20air%20540&cm_re=corsair_air_540-_-11-139-022-_-Product">Corsair Air 540</a>, it's not exactly lightweight - let alone portable. Thus, it's time to make some changes. And since I'm putting in the effort, I should also plan out how I'm going to finish the various half-done projects laying about my room.
