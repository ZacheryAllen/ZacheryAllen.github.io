        Hi! Right now, if you can see this, you probably know me. I'm going to use that as my excuse for not writing a proper introduction, because I don't like talking about myself. Ok? Ok.

        About the Site
      </h2>
      <p>
        This site is going to be a profile of my work in the IT field, as well as my personal learning goals and projects. Professionally, I have to keep things a little vague for privacy's sake, but I will go into as much detail as I can regarding my independent work. I'm hoping that having this site live will encourage me to keep up a regular schedule of practice, as I tend to forget skills that I'm not using on a regular basis. I'm also working on developing better scheduling and planning habits going forward.
